# TASK--7-ELEVATE-LABS
ðŸ§  SVM for Breast Cancer Classification

This project demonstrates how to apply **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for both **linear** and **non-linear** classification using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**. The implementation focuses on understanding the power of SVMs in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors, supported by visualization and hyperparameter tuning.

 ðŸ“Œ Objectives

* Apply SVMs to a real-world binary classification problem
* Compare linear and RBF kernels
* Visualize decision boundaries in 2D space using PCA
* Tune hyperparameters `C` and `gamma` using Grid Search
* Evaluate model performance with cross-validation

 ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is `breast-cancer.csv`, which contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei. The goal is to classify tumors as **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)**.
 ðŸ“ˆ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, encode labels, and scale features.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA to project features into 2D for easy visualization.
3. **Model Training**: Train SVMs using both linear and RBF kernels.
4. **Visualization**: Plot decision boundaries in 2D PCA space.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use `GridSearchCV` to find optimal values for `C` and `gamma`.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate performance using cross-validation and classification reports.
ðŸ“Œ Results

The RBF kernel outperformed the linear model in terms of classification accuracy and flexibility in decision boundaries, especially when using optimized hyperparameters.
ðŸ’¡ Future Work

* Extend to multiclass classification tasks
* Integrate more feature selection techniques
* Deploy as a web application for demonstration
